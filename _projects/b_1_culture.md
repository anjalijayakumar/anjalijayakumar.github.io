**Inclusion and fairness are some of the core principles that motivate my personal and professional life.**

As a leader, I want to gain literacy and competence in recognizing and nurturing knowledge and skills from diverse settings, including those created by marginalized people and places. I am part of several initiatives which will help me achieve this.

- Co-founder of a School-wide Research Associate network at the School of Engineering at Newcastle University, ‘RAing@SENG’, where I serve as a Research Associate Champion (website under construction) and regularly organise events to support RAs.
- Co-founder of a University-wide Researcher Network (We were awarded the Research Culture Funding (Co-PI £8600) to start and strengthen [Cross-Faculty RA networks](https://theresearchernetwork.wordpress.com/) in the University. I have organised several talks and workshops as part of this group including the ‘Embracing and normalising failure and rejection in and beyond academia’ and ‘Celebrating diverse career routes as we progress through academia’.

- Co-founder and Working Group Coordinator of the [Early Career Researcher Working Group](https://ebnet.ac.uk/about/wg-details/ebnet-wg-ecr/) for the Environmental Biotechnology Network, UK (funded by BBSRC).
- I have also actively created safe and inclusive spaces for collaborative research and learning, such as initiating the School Graduate Student Club at NTU Singapore in 2016, launching a Research Staff Committee in the School of GeoSciences at Edinburgh in 2021 and being a Postdoc representative of the Staff BAME Network at University of Edinburgh
