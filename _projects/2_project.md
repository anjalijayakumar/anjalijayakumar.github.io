Although research developed immensely during the last decade, the concept of biochar and it's several applications is still widely unknown to people inside and outside academia. We have created 'Char Comics', a comic strip series aiming to highlight the diverse opportunities and different application scenarios of biochar. Here's the link to our Char Comics, enjoy reading, and let us know what you think of our little Charrie by providing feedback via the google form (a QR code is provided at the end!)
