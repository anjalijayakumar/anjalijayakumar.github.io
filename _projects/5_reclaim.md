RECLAIM is a highly trans-disciplinary project where we scope the restorative justice potential of biochar technology by examining the socio-economic and environmental implications of mine-reclamation in Odisha, Eastern India. The project is in collaboration with Newcastle Law School (Prof.Darren McCauley, Dr. Sakshi Sakshi), and stakeholders in the Government of Odisha.

In December, 2023, the research team visited a bauxite mine managed by the Odisha Mining Corporation to discuss and scope the mining land reclamation strategies using biochar.
