I study decentralised, home and community-scale production of biochar via flame curtain pyrolysis. I led the first-ever systematic study investigating the effect of process conditions on emissions and biochar quality in the operation of a flame curtain pyrolysis kiln. Currently, I am working towards pilot-scale implementation of flame curtain pyrolysis including standardising the production methodology for use in several places including Bolivia for their community water management programme. With increasing popularity of decentralised pyrolysis units, it is necessary to establish a firm basis for assessing the efficiency and environmental performance of these processes.

My home backyard as a laboratory for biochar production from our backyard wastes using a home-made flame curtain pyrolyser (with my folks being brilliant lab assistants!!).
