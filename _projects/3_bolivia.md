I am leading a proof of concept study to remediate contaminated (mining wastes and organic pollutants) water using biochar technology for community-based water management programmes in Bolivia, in collaboration with and funded by NGOs CAFOD, CENDA (Cochabamba), IIADI (La Paz). Water is not just measured for its quality here; it is a highly political resource for which wars are still waged!
