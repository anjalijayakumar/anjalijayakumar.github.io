I explore the use of Biologically Enhanced Biochar for water treatment. Along with my research partners, I optimise biochar properties for cost-efficient biological water treatment for cyanotoxin removal by immobilising naturally occurring microbial communities. 

We produce Biologically Enhanced Biochar from different types of agricultural crop residue and wood waste such as coconut shells, gliricidia wood, cinnamon wood and rubber wood using batch-scale, continuous-scale, and home-scale (flame curtain pyrolysis and double barrel kiln pyrolysis) pyrolysis.

I currently work on this in collaboration with the University of Edinburrgh's UK Biochar Research Center and the microbiologists and environmental scientists at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK, and the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.
