>  <small> When teachers teach with love, combining care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust, we are often able to enter the classroom and go straight to the heart of the matter, which is knowing what to do on any given day to create the best climate for learning (B.hooks, 2003). </small> 

**Teaching Philosophy:** I passionately believe in the power of the classroom to inspire innovative solutions to resolve humanityâ€™s gravest problems. I aspire to bring the world to my classroom in all its glory and chaos to instil critical hope and inspire my students to catalyse social change for an equitable and just society, especially in the context of combating climate emergency.
