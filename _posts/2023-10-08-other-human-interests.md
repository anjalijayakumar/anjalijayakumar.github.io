When I am not working, I love to..

#### Cook and Eat!

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/food.png" title="food" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

#### Read (and Write)

My favourite genres are historical fiction and non-fiction (history, politics). Some of my favorite books are Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde, Circe (Madelline Miller), Persepolis (Marjane Satrapi), Pachinko (Min Jee Lee), Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine (Gail Honeyman), The Gene: An intimate History (Siddhartha Mukherjee)

#### Go for long walks and spend time with loved ones
